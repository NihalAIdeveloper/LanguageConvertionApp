# SIGNLANGUAGEDETECTIONUSINGCNN

## Project Overview
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and recognize sign language gestures from images.

## Files
- `collectdata.py`: Script to collect and preprocess data.
- `trainmodel.py`: Script to train the CNN model.
- `realtimedetection.py`: Script for real-time detection.
- `my_final_model.keras`: Trained model in Keras format.
- `signlanguagedetectionmodel48x48.h5`: Trained model in H5 format.
- `signlanguagedetectionmodel48x48.json`: Model architecture in JSON format.
- `recognized_text.txt`: File where recognized text is saved.
- `splitdataset48x48`: Directory containing the split dataset.
- `split.py`: Script to split the dataset.

## Installation
